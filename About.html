        Guns N' Roses formed in 1985 and released their debut album Appetite for Destruction in 1987. The album was an instant hit 
        and made Guns N' Roses a household name in the world music industry. With its hard rock and heavy metal genres, Appetite 
        for Destruction sold 28 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the United States.

        Guns N' Roses also became one of the few bands to achieve immediate international success on their debut album. Three 
        major singles were released from the album, namely Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City and also Sweet Child O'Mine, which 
        became the only Guns N' Roses song to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song is also considered to be one of the best 
        rock songs of all time that is most popular until now.

        After that, Guns N' Roses immediately released a second album entitled G N' R Lies in 1988. Guns N' Roses' success 
        increased after releasing a double-album in 1991, entitled Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II. The two albums were 
        released in the same year and in their debut week occupied positions 2 and 1 of the Billboard 200. Some of Guns N' Roses' 
        best songs are found on these two albums, such as November Rain and Don't Cry.

        Guns N' Roses then released their 5th album, The Spaghetti Incident in 1993. However, this album did not meet expectations 
        and marked the heyday of Guns N' Roses which lasted for more than 7 years. After that, one by one Guns N' Roses personnel 
        decided to resign due to lack of clarity regarding the next Guns N' Roses project and several other reasons.

    <p style="margin-right: 9%; margin-left: 9%; margin-top: 5px;">
        Guns N' Roses' last album Chinese Democracy was released in 2008, with several new personnel, even though it caused a lot
        of controversy. After that there were several changes in the formation of Guns N' Roses, including the rejoining of old 
        members of the band.
